This study examines the distribution of airborne heavy metal emissions across UK industries from 1990 to 2022 and evaluates their health impacts on vulnerable populations. 
By correlating emission data with public health outcomes, particularly respiratory, neurological, and cardiovascular diseases, we identify high-risk areas and major pollution sources. 
Monte Carlo simulations are used to forecast future emissions and address uncertainties in health risks from heavy metal exposure. 
The analysis categorizes heavy metals into carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic groups, highlighting the need for targeted regulations. 
This research emphasizes the integration of predictive models in public health policies and environmental regulations to mitigate long-term health risks from heavy metal pollution.
